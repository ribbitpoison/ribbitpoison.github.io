# Hi there!

Welcome to my page. I'm dsm_ribbitpoison.

I'm a TikToker that specializes on speaking about daily topics, and cars. I'm highly critical when it comes to stuff.

On my spare time that I have nothing else to do, I focus on my gaming server/community focused around on Freedom of Speech called Project Fairness, with a FiveM server of the same name.

I also focus on modding other games such as GTA V/FiveM, and have also done work on the Call of Duty Mod Tools since 4-5 years ago.

# Links/Shortcuts

You should definitely check out [my other links](https://beacons.ai/ribbitpoison)!

If you want to play on Project Fairness, [here is a direct link](https://cfx.re/join/7kvpzr) to my FiveM server. Alternatively, you can also join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/h32vVbEQR4) for Project Fairness on multiple platforms (FiveM, Call of Duty, ATS/ETS, Minecraft...).

I also work on GTA V/FiveM under the Starshine Mod Shop label, in dedication to my old group, Diamond Starlights. You're more than welcome if you want to see some [future GTA V/FiveM work here](https://discord.gg/D7cVc8TzPN).

If you are wanting to see my work for Call of Duty under the Venom Modding label, I suggest you [look here](https://ribbitpoison.github.io/venommodding.github.io/).
